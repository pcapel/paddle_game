# Paddle Game
This is my first foray into using pygames.  I decided to create a paddle game that would feel pretty familiar to anyone who grew up in the same timeframe as me.  Or, you know, anyone who has been alive in the last 50 years basically.  Anyway, I got the basic gist of the game down and decided that I wanted to expand the scope of it a bit (lol, I know right?).

Currently I have a few goals in mind, but the three main goals are as such:

1. Create playable levels that track user progress.
  * Pending actually making the game mechanics work.
2. Create a level editor playground where players can edit, play, and save their own levels.
  * Stomach may be bigger than my eyes on this one...
3. Create upgrades and drops.
  * This is just necessary for it to be any good at all, really.

So this is, and probably will be an ongoing project for the next few weeks, among others.
If you have any input on it, feel free to hit me up.  I'm always trying to learn!
